## ⚙️ Performance Optimization Guide

Heavy active web content compositor render loops can utilize significant client viewport resources. Follow these recommendations to secure buttery-smooth viewport animations:

1. **Reduce Target Frame Rate (FPS)** – Lower the target FPS preset inside the Canvas Panel to trim idle CPU processing workloads.
2. **Deactivate Hidden Sources** – Hide or lock static components when not in active use to skip drawing computations on active layout sweeps.
3. **Isolate Code Elements** – Throttle intensive setInterval loops in your Code Sandbox sources to preserve main-thread processing memory.
